Everyone does not
have to like me
NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
As uncomfortable this knowing may feel, I
have to remind myself that it's ok to be
disliked, and it's ok to be who I am. Unless
I've seriously aggrieved someone (for which I
must own up to my mistakes), people's
perception of me comes mostly from their
own triggers and the mound they have of
how people should be/behave. I cannot be
everything to everyone. I can only be myself,
and that is enough.

Empath Affirmations

@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
It is not my job to fix or change anyone.
• Managing my energy is important. I will say NO to things that drain me.
• My feelings are mine. I do not have to
defend them or explain why I have
them.

4 reminders for empaths
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
DON'T:
1. Give attention to people who repeatedly
hurt you
2. Lower your standards just because someone
does not see your worth
3. Force yourself to forgive before you're truly
ready
4.Suppress or ignore your feelings

Today I will focus on things that are within my control
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
These include:
-My words
-My actions
-The boundaries I set
-How I engage my feelings
-How authentic I present myself to others
-How I treat every human I encounter
I will not, however, focus on things that are 
outside my control including:
-What other people do, say or feel.

This chapter of my life is called 'ME"
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
-I'm learning to love ME
-I'm learning to listen to ME (my inner voice)
-I'm learning to respect ME
-I'm learning to be more kind to ME.
For everyone else in my life, I hope you care enough about my wellbeing to understand.

You never know you've been people-pleasing
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
until resentment starts to set in...until
you start withdrawing and avoiding
people...until you start making excuses.
All along you thought you were being
"nice" when really you were
unconsciously sabotaging yourself. And
then you wonder why you no longer
"vibe" with a person. Perhaps it was
never about them. Perhaps it was about
you- learning to end a cycle that has
kept you trapped for far too long.

3 mindful statements
for the week ahead
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
-I don't have to explain myself to everyone
(besides those in my immediate circle).
My choices are mine.
-I don't need to adjust my boundary
because you feel uncomfortable. It was set
for a reason.
-I can care for others, and care for myself at
the same time. Both worlds can exist
together.

You don't have to feel
bad for walking away
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
from something that you felt wasn't serving
you. Perhaps you feel bad, guilty, or
question your decision, and that's ok. You're
allowed to process the loss of something
that was once dear and meaningful to you.
You don't have to push away the feelings or
think negatively about the other person in
order to move on. Self-respect isn't about
making the other person a villain. It's
knowing that some situations and people
don't fit with your specific values, and that's
ok.
- NEETA MAHARAJ
The Empath Psychologist








You're allowed to
take space
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
or remove yourself from any situation that
causes you distress. Sometimes space gives
you a chance to process what has
happened and to approach the situation
with a new outlook. Don't feel guilty or bad
for it. You don't need to react immediately,
nor do you need to have a response right
away. Sometimes keeping your calm and
taking some time out is all you need.

People who are
not in touch
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
with their emotions will make you feel
like you're crazy for expressing yours.
You may hear things like "you're too
sensitive" or "stop being so emotional."
But know that nothing is wrong with
you. Being attuned to how you feel and
the ability to verbalize it is precious,
especially in a world that is
increasingly teaching you how to
numb yourself.

You not "needing"
anyone
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
is a trauma response to you having to deal with
everything on your own as a child. Being super
independent is not a sign of strength, nor a sign
of "having it all together." It's pointing to shame.
Shame of the perception of "not being able to
handle it all." But why should you feel ashamed
for that? No one, I assure you, is perfect or has it
all together. So stop placing so much pressure
on yourself. It's ok to reach out and ask for help.
And it's ok to not have it all together.

Me, setting a boundary

It's me making a decision to stop sabotaging

It isn't about hurting you or being "difficult."
If you care about me, you'd understand that
my wellbeing is just as important as yours.

You can't save people.
@NEETAMAHARAJ COM
I know you care so much that
sometimes you get too involved in the
lives of others. But you forget that
everyone has to go through their own
lessons (and learn it on their terms, in
their time). So you can't save people.
People have to save themselves. You can
lend support, listen and hold space. But
be careful when "being there" crosses
the line of creating dependency and
disabling someone.

Just because I'm a nice
person
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
doesn't mean it's an invitation for others to be
disrespectful or rude.
-Nice people can draw boundaries.
-Nice people can say NO
-Nice people can stand their ground.
And it doesn't make them "less nice" when
they do it. It makes them a "nice person" who
won't allow people to bully them.

Dear Empaths,
nothing is wrong
with you.
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
You don't have dislike yourself, or pretend
to be someone you're not in order to fit in or
be liked. You will, however, greatly benefit
from being yourself and embracing all the
things that you previously disliked about
being you. Because your ability to be
sensitive, and your ability to feel things
deeply is a true gift in a world that is
numbing, cold and cut-throat. Be yourself.
Appreciate your unique gifts. The world
needs more empathic warriors.

The reason why you
become drained
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
when you're around some people is
that you're not listening to your
feelings of what you need in that
moment. It's OK to politely excuse
yourself, say "NO," not bend into
pressure or acknowledge that you
I don't have to force a conversation. Real
connection comes from being yourself
and being attuned to what is "showing
up" inside of you in the moment.
Nothing else.

Maybe you don't speak
your truth
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
because you're afraid that people would judge you
or it may lead to a confrontation. Maybe you're
afraid that somehow your truth will push them
away. But here's the beautiful thing about "truth"-
it reveals everything.
Maybe speaking your truth might lead to a
realization that some people, situations or
circumstances are not for you. And that's ok. Not
everyone or everything has to work. When you come
to terms with this, you'll find yourself in a new era of
peace, where everything in your life becomes an
authentic reflection of you.

I pray that you quit
chasing people
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
that you cease trying to win the approval
of others...that you'd stop trying to prove
yourself over and over...or making it "nice"
with people who don't really care about
your wellbeing. You have to realise your
worth at some point, and know that if you
chose to walk away or close the door, it is
TOTALLY OK.

Valuable life lessons
for empaths
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
1. It's literally impossible to please everyone. Don't
even try. You run the risk of burn-out and
exhaustion.
2. It doesn't make you weak if you ask for help.
Asking for help is a sign of strength
3. It's not your responsibility to fix everyone else's
problems. You can be kind and caring without
taking on the task of problem-solving for others.
4. Don't manage your time... instead manage your
energy!

Not all toxic people
are intentionally
mean
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
or selfish. Some are actually really nice
people who tend to cope with life by being
caught in a cycle of childhood wounds.
Remember this when you feel the need to
label someone as "toxic." And, as far I am
concerned, we can all be toxic at times.
Now, of course, knowing this is not an
excuse for accepting or enabling unhealthy
behaviors. It just allows us to stop being so
self-righteous about it.

Purpose in life can
be found in the little
things
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
You don't have to be doing "grand" things in
life in order to live purposefully, or feel a sense
of meaning to your existence. Purpose often
comes from the little things that can make a
big difference. It's in the moments of listening
actively to a friend who needs to share, or
giving your time to the needy, or randomly
doing an act of kindness, without the need for
praise, or attention from it. This is how we
impact. each other. This is how we remember
our humanity.

The "other"
serenity prayer
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
God,
Grant me the serenity to stop
beating myself up for not doing
things perfectly, the courage to
forgive myself because I'm working
on doing better, and the wisdom to
know that I'm already loved just
the way I am.

It's ok to...
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
- Want people to like you
- Feel uncomfortable whilst setting and enforcing
Boundaries
-Be sad if you walked away from someone who was
once dear to you.
Remember, you're human. You will naturally seek
approval and feel guilty for doing things that may
impact others. But be careful when these things
begin to run your life such that you're constantly
dishonoring yourself for the sake of others. So as a
gentle reminder, honor your need for respect. And the
only person that begins with, is YOU.

A lot of suffering is caused
by you not listening to
what you need
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
to do for yourself, and trying to live life for
others- by pleasing, complying and playing
nice...all because you're afraid that who you are,
and what you want, is not enough. But I'm here
to tell you that unless you stop seeking
validation from others, you will always find
yourself trapped in a cycle of doing things that
are not aligned with YOU. So a gentle reminder
to listen your inner voice, DO YOU, and tell
yourself that whatever judgements come your
way, you will affirm to yourself that you are
enough- always have been and always will be."

You know what
happens when you begin
standing up
for yourself?
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
You don't lose real friends, relationships, or opportunities.
You lose people who had an agenda, or who were so
stuck in "ME" mode that they failed to recognize that you
too had needs. So a gentle reminder to speak up, to dare
to confront, to draw the lines for how you wish to be
treated. Remember, you won't lose anything that is real.
Real friendships/ relationships would make an attempt
to understand your stance.

Sometimes you
have to accept
that people are:
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM

stuck
And none of that has anything to do
with you.

Today's mantra:
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
I'm deserving, even on days, when I don't
feel like it, or on days when others make
me feel less than.
Because, in reality, I know myself, and I
know that I am a good person.
So I won't let my inner critic or the voice
of others get in my way.
I am deserving.
I am worthy.
I am enough.

Dear Self,

-My actions
-The boundaries I set

Not because you've
known someone for a
long time,
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
or they're part of your family or friend circle,
does not mean that you have to put up with
toxic behaviors or "play nice." You don't have
to "keep the peace," or be the "bigger
person." You are required, however, to be
true to yourself and not indulge in self-
sabotage by allowing people to abuse, take
advantage or bully you. So have the courage
to close doors, walk away or do whatever is
necessary to preserve your sense of peace.
You're not doing this to spite anyone. You
doing this for you. And that's what's
important. - NEETA MAHARAJ

Note to self:
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
When things feel heavy,
overwhelming and confusing, I have
to remember that:
- I can take it one day at a time
- I don't have to have it all figured
out now.
- I don't owe anyone an explanation
for taking time out for myself
- I will be ok.

"Be easy on yourself
my friend
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
There are no timelines in life.
Only limits that we set for ourselves
based on pressure we receive from the outside world.
It's ok not to have it altogether.
It's ok not to know what the next step is.
It's ok to be a bit confused.
For life isn't a race to perfection.
or to see who is better at "perfecting life."
So take it easy my friend.
You're doing the best you can.

You don't need
anyone's approval
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
to take up space or to have validation of
your worth. If someone rejects you, or
treats you unkindly, it's rarely a
reflection of you. It's most of the time a
projection of their own fears, insecurities
and struggles. Sometimes it's even
circumstances, that may have nothing
to do with you. So a gentle reminder to
place this in perspective. You are:
Worthy. Enough. Valid.

Not everything
needs a reaction
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
If you keep reacting to everything
around you, you risk going into mental
exhaustion. Sometimes, it's best to let
something go (temporarily) and give
your mind space to attend to things
that really matter.
Note: this is not suppression. It's chosing
where to place your attention, in this
moment, so that you don't end up
draining your energy.

Some relationships help
you grow,
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
no matter the uncomfortable moments and
disagreements. But some relationships leave you
consistently drained, wounded and terribly
misunderstood. And these are relationships you
can leave behind- not because you aren't
growing, but because the relationship in itself,
does more damage than good.
You don't have to feel guilty for this. Staying in
something unhealthy is not a sign of strength.

If, in an effort to
"be nice"
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
you've suppressed your feelings and
thoughts, then you've actually not
been nice. You've complied. Which
means, you disowned parts of who
you are, in order to fit in and be
liked. Don't do this to yourself. You
never know how your small corner of
the world can be changed by an
authentic you.

Sometimes,
in trying to share
how you feel,
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
you might be ignored, blamed, or called
too sensitive. The automatic response to
this, is a withdrawal into yourself, and a
shutting down of your voice. Because in
essence, this is your safe place...the place
where you don't feel like anyone can hurt
you. And although I get that, I want you to
know that speaking up is important and
that your voice matters. So speak up
anyway. It is your birthright.

For some people
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
you might be too much. For others, you
may have to shrink who you are in order
to maintain the connection, or even fit in.
These are not your people. Consider
closing the door and walking away. You
deserve to be loved and accepted by
people who appreciate you as you are.
And real connections do not require you

Good vibes only" can
be garbage advice!
@NEETAMAHARAJ.COM
I know it's helpful to be optimistic and build
hope at times... but you can't placate or run
from suffering. It's simply not a wound that you
can place a cheap bandaid over, as you carry on
your life telling everyone that you're ok, as you
try to force yourself into feeling "good vibes."
Sometimes you have to go into the pain and
sometimes you have to feel it. Because quite
frankly, that's the only way it's going to go away.
Remember, no amount of forced positivity can
heal you the way you need to heal. Healing
sometimes requires courage to face things we
often don't want to face.

Respecting boundaries

Hard truth
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
You cannot go through a process of
becoming your most authentic self, and
expect everyone in your circle to stick
around. Some people will walk away. Not
because you did anything wrong, but
because who you are now, no longer
resonates with them. That's nothing to do
with you. It's ok to let them go...to grieve
their loss, and what once was.
But remember to stay true to your process
of healing, and remember to stay true to
your process of becoming.

It doesn't interest me
how many times you
meditate,
@NEETA MAHARAJ.COM
go to church, pray or try to be positive. I'm
interested in the ways you show human
kindness, the ways in which you do the right
thing when no one is watching, and your
overall capacity to reflect on yourself and
own up to your shortcomings. Because the
mark of a good human being isn't shown in
his spiritual or religious affiliations. It's
reflected in his heart.
